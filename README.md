# Hidden Markov Model algorithms

Inspired by the Murphy's book on machine learning.

Basic implementation of Forwards, Forward-Backwards, Baum-Welch and model fitting from known states and data for discrete probabilities (Multinoulli).

To be used carefully and with patience. 

Dependencies: >python3.6, hmmlearn, pandas, numpy, sklearn
